I am a Masterâ€™s student at the University of Gothenburg/Chalmers studying statistics.
Currently doing 3 month internship in the Scientific Computing and Consulting (SCC) group within Biostatistics at Novartis in Basel, Switzerland.

I am born and raised in Los Angeles, California and am a Swedish/US citizen.
In my free time I enjoy rock climbing and hiking.
