This summer I am doing a 3 month internship in the Scientific Computing and Consulting (SCC) group within Biostatistics at Novartis in Basel, Switzerland.
We do data visualizations and analytics mostly with R and Shiny.
I figured since I am working in R all summer, it would be fitting to convert my blog over to [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/), to be able to write directly using R markdown.
