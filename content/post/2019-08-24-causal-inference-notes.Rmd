## Introduction
These are my notes from [Miguel HernÃ¡n's book on Causal Inference](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/)

### Sources of Random Variability
  1. Sampling Variability - sample value not equal to the population value we are trying to estimate.
  2. Nondeterministic counterfactuals - an individual's counterfactual outcomes might not be fixed in advance.

## Definitions
  - $Y^{a = 1}, Y^{a = 0}$ Potential outcomes, counterfactual outcomes. What would have occured, had the individual been treated with $A$ and also if not treated. May not actually occur.
    - If an individual, i, is treated, then $A = 1$ and $Y_i^{a = 1} = 1 = Y_i$
  - Causal effect for an individual: the treatment has a causal effect on the ind outcome Y if $ \not = Y^{a = 0}$
  - Consistency - An individual with observed outcome A equal to $a$ has observed outcome Y equal to his counterfactual outcome $Y^a$.
