<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>These are my notes from <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/">Miguel Hernán’s book on Causal Inference</a></p>

<h3>Sources of Random Variability</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sampling Variability - sample value not equal to the population value we are trying to estimate.</li>
<li>Nondeterministic counterfactuals - an individual’s counterfactual outcomes might not be fixed in advance.</li>
</ol>

<div id="definitions" class="section level2">
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Y^{a = 1}, Y^{a = 0}\)</span> Potential outcomes, counterfactual outcomes. What would have occured, had the individual been treated with <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and also if not treated. May not actually occur.
<ul>
<li>If an individual, i, is treated, then <span class="math inline">\(A = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_i^{a = 1} = 1 = Y_i\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Causal effect for an individual: the treatment has a causal effect on the ind outcome Y if $ = Y^{a = 0}$</li>
<li>Consistency - An individual with observed outcome A equal to <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> has observed outcome Y equal to his counterfactual outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y^a\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
